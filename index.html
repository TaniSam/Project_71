                        The School gives a lot of emphasis on service with love for the needy and less privileged groups of the society. The students are taught to appreciate the blessings bestowed upon them by God and share whatever they can to help the poor and the deprived. For this end we conduct the Social Service Week every year to collect certain basic items such as rice, cereals, clothes, biscuits, soaps, books and stationery and cash. The children are taken to various locations to practice what they learn. The students distribute the collected items to the needy during their field trips.

Godric valued courage and bravery, believing these were the two most virtuous abilities a person can possess. Gryffindor was the original owner of the Sorting Hat, which he and his fellow founders enchanted to select people to be sorted into their houses, by seeing the qualities each founder valued the most. His house corresponds to the element of fire.

A kind and warm woman, she believed that, in order to be sorted into Hufflepuff house, a person must possess the values of loyalty, patience, and be hard-working above all else. It is also known that she brought the house-elves to Hogwarts. She owned a fine golden cup which was fairly innocuous aside from being her possession. The cup was sought by Lord Voldemort nearly a thousand years later, for him to turn it into a Horcrux. She was the best friend of Rowena Ravenclaw. Her house corresponds to the element of earth.

                            The founder of Slytherin house. Sly and cunning, he was not unlike many of the students he brought into his house. He believed strongly that only wizards of pure blood (i.e., those with a mother and father from wizarding families) should be allowed to attend Hogwarts. Slytherin caused great dispute over this with the other founders, and it eventually caused a permanent rift with Gryffindor, which led to Slytherin's departure from the school.[2] Before he left, however, he created the Chamber of Secrets,[2] complete with a huge statue of himself with a horrible monster lurking inside. His house corresponds to the element of water.[
